# Analyzing-and-Predicting-Bike-Rentals
### (Data handling and Machine learning using Dask, Scikit Learn and Tensorflow)

### Introduction
Bike sharing systems are increasingly popular in urban areas as a convenient and eco-friendly transportation mode. Understanding the factors influencing bike rental demand can help optimize bike availability, infrastructure planning, and resource allocation for bike-sharing companies.
This project aims to analyze bike sharing data and develop a machine learning model to predict bike rental demand. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we seek to uncover insights into bike rental patterns and build an accurate predictive model.
### Objectives
-  Analyze the distribution of bike rentals across different time periods (hourly, daily, monthly, seasonal).
-  Investigate the impact of weather conditions, day of the week, and other factors on bike rental demand.
-  Develop a machine learning model to predict bike rental counts based on relevant features.
-  Evaluate the performance of the predictive model.
### Dataset
The dataset is available at (UCI Machine Learning Repository) http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset. The dataset is also avalable in this repository as "hour.csv". The dataset consists of historical bike rental data collected over two years.
### Methodology
#### Data Preprocessing
-  Handle missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation using Dask.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-  Visualize the dataset to understand distributions, correlations, and trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
#### Feature Selection
-  Identify relevant features for the predictive model.
#### Model Development
-  Build a machine learning model using TensorFlow to predict bike rental demand.
#### Model Evaluation
-  Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.
